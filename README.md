## About The Project

### Choosing React

I went with React because I've been using it comfortably for two years—it's like my coding companion. I know its tools and testing well, making it the best fit to show off what I can do. But hey, I'm not stuck in my ways—if there's a need for Vue or another library, I'm open to exploring.

### Choosing TypeScript

I picked TypeScript because it's been my go-to for the past year. It's not just for coding—it's great for documenting. I wanted to show I can handle types and enums well, especially with React using things like FC and precise state typings.

### Testing with React Testing Library / Jest

Testing might sound fancy, but it's like making sure everything works smoothly. I set up tests for React components and standalone functions, making sure they're organized and easy to understand. Plus, I can do cool stuff like mock functions and spy on global methods using Jest. Testing game strong!

### SVGs as React components

I turned SVGs into React components for easy styling using props. It's a simple way to control visuals with a modular design approach.

### Choosing CSS

Usually, I use fancy CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, but for this project, I kept it simple with CSS modules. Less fuss, more straightforward — just what the project needed.

### Prettier setup

I set up a Prettier script to keep the code looking sharp and consistent throughout the project. It's the secret sauce for a codebase that's not just smart but also looks good.
