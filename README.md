<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is built with a focus on leveraging key technologies and best practices to create a robust and maintainable codebase.

Here are the technical choices I made during development:

### Choosing React

Comfort and Familiarity: Given my two years of hands-on development experience with React, I feel most comfortable with this library, its tooling and testing methodology.

Skill Representation: As previously mentioned, I believe that using React would represent my skills more accurately for this assessment. However, I'm always willing to learn new stacks (like Vue) and I believe that my current experience would be relevant and speed up my learning.

### Choosing TypeScript

Code Documentation: I opted for TypeScript to enhance code documentation, leveraging a year of prior experience. This decision allows me to showcase my understanding of types and enums and how they can be used to avoid hard-coded values.

Type Safety with React: Throughout the project, I've demonstrated the integration of React and TypeScript, using inherited React types like "FC" and typing the "useState" hooks when needed.

### Testing with React Testing Library / Jest

Unit and Functional Tests: I have implemented unit and functional tests for React components separately, organized within "describe" blocks for clarity. You'll also see examples of function mocking and global method (fetch) mocking/spying.

Jest Usage in Functions: I've showcased the use of Jest for unit testing in functions outside of the React context, specifically `utils/products.tsx`.

Avoiding Redundancy: Despite my familiarity with Storybook, given the small nature of the project I chose not to use it to prevent redundancy, as functional tests were already established.

Test Coverage: Due to time constraints, I decided to not unit-test small components. This has been a conscious decision and not an oversight.

### SVGs as React components

Props-Driven Styling: I wrapped SVGs in React components, allowing me to use props for dynamic styling. This enhances the flexibility and reusability of the assets.

### Choosing CSS

CSS Modules for Simplicity: While I've been working mostly with CSS-in-JS libraries, specifically styled-components, I decided to use CSS modules in this project to minimize complexity and streamline styling practices.

### Prettier setup

Consistent Code Styling: To maintain consistency throughout the codebase, I've set up a Prettier script. This ensures a uniform and clean coding style, reflecting my commitment to code quality and readability.
